Exercise

Write some code that takes in numbers from a user one at a time. This should keep going until the user enters 0. Then print the sum of all the numbers.
If the user inputs something that isn't a number, an error message should appear and the program should stop. (Hint: use break)

Example (no error):
5
12
0
Sum: 17

Example (error):
5
7
c
Error: Not a number

''' Example
Use the continue keyword to loop through a string and only print the vowels.

Exercise

Write some code that takes in strings from a user one at a time.
After each string is taken in evaluate if the string is empty, a number, a set of letters, or contains symbols.
If the string is empty, stop the loop.
If the string is a number, convert it to a float and add it to a total.
If the string is a set of letters, concatenate to the other letter strings passed in.
If it contains a symbol, or is none of the above, do nothing and repeat the loop.
Make sure to use break and/or continue.
